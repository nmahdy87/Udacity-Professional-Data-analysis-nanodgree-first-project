Bike Share data project
This is the first project in the Udacity Data analysis nanodegree (professional track)
Basic Data Exploration with pandas on Bikeshare Data
A Python project using pandas to explore bikeshare data from three major U.S. cities - Chicago, Washington, and New York City - to display information such as most popular days or most common stations.
The program was built using python 3.8. I recommend running it on Anaconda.
